### **Data-driven Framework for Property Prediction and Optimization in Lattice Metamaterials**  
**September 2024 – Present | University of Science and Technology of China**  

Provides an algorithmic framework for predicting and analyzing the fracture properties of two-dimensional lattice
materials, offering a reasonable explanation for the excellent mechanical properties of sponge bone needle materials. 

#### Key Contributions:   
- Building parameter models for lattice materials with ABAQUS.Establish a structure-property correlation for lattice
materials with a combination of variational encoders, gradient boosting algorithms, and evolutionary
strategies,based on Pytorch.
- Achieving better fitting results than traditional MLPs in small samples.Empirically demonstrate the fracture
toughness of a symmetrically distributed lattice structure is approximately 70.83% higher than that of a general
structure.

### **Design and 3D Printing of Fracture-resistant Gradient TPMS Metamaterials**  
**August 2025 – Present | University of Hong Kong**  

Develop TPMS - structured mechanical metamaterials for specific loads by changing the gradient ranges of unit
thickness and relative density.

#### Key Contributions:  
- Perform finite element analysis (FEA) to simulate the mechanical behavior of the designed structures under different
loading conditions.Use in-situ mechanical testing to test the specimens prepared via 3D-printing. 
- It is expected to significantly increase the energy dissipation of the material, prolong the crack propagation path, and
thereby improve the fracture toughness.

**July 2022 – May 2023 | University of Science and Technology of China**  

Explosive bonding of copper and steel plates

#### Key Contributions:  
- Calculate the theoretical amount of explosives based on empirical formulas, prepared copper-steel composite plates
by explosive welding experiment.
- Found through characterization that the interface formed typical wavy bonds with a bonding rate of over 98%, providing a reasonable explanation for its bonding toughness and crack resistance.
