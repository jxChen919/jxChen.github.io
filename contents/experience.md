### **Microstructure design and 3D printing of fracture-resistant biomimetic metamaterials**  
**September 2024 â€“ August 2025 | University of Science and Technology of China**  

Establish a data-driven framework to analyze the relationship between the structure and mechanical properties of different 2D lightweight lattice metamaterials, and use inverse design methods to discover designs with optimal fracture resistance.

#### Key Contributions:  
- Establish a 2D structural material model similar to sponge bone needles to enable quantitative research on different structural materials.  
- Use finite element analysis methods to obtain the fracture mechanics properties of structural materials in batches, and verify the accuracy of the simulation.  
- Use VAE to decode the parameter characteristics of structural materials, train the XGBoost model with the obtained latent vectors, and obtain the mapping relationship between the parameter model and mechanical properties.
- Develop evolutionary strategies for reverse engineering the most resilient structures and verify the stability and robustness of the optimal range.
